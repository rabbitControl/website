## Launch Client  
From any browser (desktop or mobile) open this URL:  
http://client.rabbitcontrol.cc  
Enter Host and Port of your rcp server application and click Connect.

Or directly connect to an rcp server by providing ip:port in the URL like e.g:  
http://client.rabbitcontrol.cc/#192.168.0.23:10000

After connecting to a rabbitControl server you should now see all exposed parameters. e.g.:
