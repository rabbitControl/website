Get [RCPSharp](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RCPSharp) nuget from nuget.org. Source is available [here](https://github.com/rabbitControl/rcp-csharp).

See [Demo for exposing parameters](https://github.com/rabbitControl/rcp-csharp/blob/master/demos/RCPSharpDemo/Server.cs)

Use a [client]({{< relref "/clients" >}}) to control exposed parameters.
